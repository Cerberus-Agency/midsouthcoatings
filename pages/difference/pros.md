<div class="right steps">

**STEP 1: INSPECTION** MidSouth Coating’s professional staff inspects your home’s exterior in detail, identifying any damaged areas that may need to be repaired in order to provide a seamless surface for coating.

**STEP 2: TRENCHING** Experienced team members will dig a shallow trench around the bottom edge of your home’s exterior to ensure complete coverage.

**STEP 3: PRESSURE WASHING** Using a powerful press washing system, our pros will thoroughly clean your home’s exterior, carefully removing any loose dirt for a smooth surface.

**STEP 4: REPAIR & PATCH**  Our expert craftsmen will repair or patch any damaged or deteriorated areas identified during our inspection using our specially formulated filler, TEX-BOND<sup>&reg;</sup> & FLEX PATCH<sup>&reg;</sup> products.

**STEP 5: MASKING** Very few home exterior coatings companies or painters take the time to perform this important step. We carefully cover and mask all surfaces that are not being coated, including windows, doors, lawn, shrubs, walkways and driveways.

**STEP 6: PRIMER APPLICATION** Operating at a pressure of up to 3,000 psi, our team completely and thoroughly applies a coat of our COOLWALL<sup>&reg;</sup> primer, a product so innovative, it set the industry standard.

**STEP 7: INSPECTION** Before the next coat is applied, we carefully reinspect the entire exterior to ensure full, uniform, and proper coverage.

**STEP 8: COOLWALL<sup>&reg;</sup> SUPERCOAT** Our pros apply your COOLWALL<sup>&reg;</sup> color to exterior walls in the proper and uniform thickness to ensure lasting, durable protection that’s [guaranteed to last a lifetime](/difference/guarantee).

**STEP 9: TRIM-COTE<sup>&reg;</sup>** Once the exterior walls are thoroughly covered, our experienced team inspects, repairs, caulks, primes and applies a specially formulated and patented TRIM-COTE<sup>&reg;</sup> product to the home’s trim around windows, doors, and edges.

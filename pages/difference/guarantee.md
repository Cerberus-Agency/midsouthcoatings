Before COOLWALL&reg; colors were introduced in the market, homeowners typically selected lighter colors for their ability to reflect much of the sun’s radiation back into the atmosphere, keeping the structure cooler and reducing fading. Today, more and more homeowners are choosing darker COOLWALL&reg; colors because of their heat reflective properties and superior fade resistance.

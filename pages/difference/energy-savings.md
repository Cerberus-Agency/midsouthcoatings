# ENERGY SAVINGS: COOLWALL&reg; COLORS REDUCE COOLING COSTS BY UP TO 21.9%

![](/static/img/MSC-energysavings-inset.jpg)

Energy savings of up to 21.9% is based on the Department of Energy study which showed savings on homes with COOLWALL&reg; ranged from 4.2% to 21.9%. 

Across the Southern U.S., cooling even a moderate size house can require over 1500 hours of air conditioning operation a year, so cooling these homes can be extremely expensive. On a hot day, homes can absorb as much as 90% of the sun’s rays and even white walls absorb a significant amount of this radiant energy. COOLWALL&reg; colors are, on average, 100% more reflective than conventional products. In fact, our advanced, next-gen home coating has been proven to reduce exterior wall temperatures up to 40°. 

Specially formulated to deflect heat energy away from the home, the COOLWALL&reg; system helps to reduce interior temperatures as well. This means air conditioning systems don’t have to work as hard to maintain comfortable temperatures, so they use less electricity. 

Over nearly a two-year period, the COOLWALL&reg; System was tested by the U.S. Department of Energy’s Oak Ridge National Laboratory to determine its true energy-saving qualities. The study found that the COOLWALL&reg; System significantly reduced exterior wall temperatures while reducing energy consumption in concrete block, stucco, and wood-framed homes. The study also found that the COOLWALL&reg; System reduced cooling costs by up to 21.9%*.

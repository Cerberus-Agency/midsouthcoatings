# COOLWALL&reg; COLORS

Before COOLWALL&reg; colors were introduced in the market, homeowners typically selected lighter colors for their ability to reflect much of the sun’s radiant energy back into the atmosphere. Today, more and more homeowners are choosing darker COOLWALL&reg; colors because of their heat reflective properties and superior fade resistance. If you can’t find your perfect color, let us know and we’ll work with you to create your own custom color.

NOTE: The colors displayed in this modeling tool are likely to look different than they would on your house. The best way to see our colors is to request a [free quote](/contact) so that a member of our staff can show you the COOLWALL&reg; colors in person.

In fact, COOLWALL<sup>&reg;</sup> uses the same heat reflective technology first developed by the military to reduce the heat signature of its combat vehicles. Our patented infrared heat reflective coatings not only provide for lower surface temperatures, each of our 570 COOLWALL<sup>&reg;</sup> [colors](/color-chart) is [guaranteed to protect and beautify for a lifetime](/difference/guarantee). And because our coatings stay much cooler than every other exterior coating solution, heat buildup is greatly reduced, which means less expansion and contraction stress.

On average, MidSouth Coating’s COOLWALL<sup>&reg;</sup> colors are 100% more reflective than the conventional technologies used in every competing product sold. Tests conducted by the U.S. Department of Energy over nearly a two-year period demonstrate the COOLWALL<sup>&reg;</sup> system’s ability to save more energy than other exterior home coatings, including paint and ceramic coatings. The study found that the COOLWALL<sup>&reg;</sup> System significantly reduced exterior wall temperatures while reducing [energy consumption](/difference/energy-savings) in concrete block, stucco, Hardie board, and wood-framed homes. While most coatings claim to be [“green”](/difference/energy-savings) by cutting VOCs, only COOLWALL<sup>&reg;</sup> cuts emissions through reflectivity, utilizes recycled materials, and helps [reduce cooling costs](/differnece/energy-savings).

#SERVICE AREA:

##BEAUTIFYING THE ENTIRE GULF COAST REGION.

MAP:	Greater Lafayette, Baton Rouge, New Orleans, Gulport, Biloxi, Mobile, Pensacola, and Destin.

Ideally suited to meet the challenges of the Gulf Coast climate, COOLWALL® is impervious to water penetration, an essential performance parameter in humid and moist climates. This advanced commercial-grade coating also allows the underlying building surface to breathe, helping to prevent decay and the growth of mold and mildew. And because our coatings stay much cooler than every other exterior coating solution, heat buildup is greatly reduced, which means less expansion and contraction stress, too. COOLWALL&reg; colors resist fading in the merciless summer sun and our next-gen exterior coating resists pitting and chipping better than ordinary house paints and lesser “rhino” coatings sold in our service area.

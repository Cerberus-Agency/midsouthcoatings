#FAQs:

What makes COOLWALL® a green product? While most coatings claim to be green by cutting VOCs, only COOLWALL® cuts emissions through reflectivity, utilizes recycled materials, and helps reduce cooling costs. This next-gen exterior coatings product manufactured by TEX-COTE®:

- contains heat reflective properties to reduce surface temperatures and can provide for cooling cost energy savings
- has heat reflective technology that also leads to increased durability and fade resistance due to less expansion and contraction stress on the coating, greatly extending the product life-cycle
- incorporates post-industrial recycled glass to further increase sustainability
- has been recognized by prominent LEED™ accredited professionals as being worthy of submission for LEED credits in up to three of the six LEED categories
- can lower cooling electricity usage during peak demand hours, which can result in significant cost savings*
- allows you to experience lower surface temperatures as a result of increased reflectivity without sacrificing color and visual appeal—providing lower surface temperatures in all colors not just white
- uses the same infrared heat reflective technology used by the U.S. military to reduce radar signatures on its planes and vehicles
- works by reflecting much of the infrared light back into the atmosphere, lowering surface temperatures by up to 40 degrees Fahrenheit*
- incorporates patented FADE BLOCK™ technology that is virtually immune to the effects of harmful UV radiation, which include degrading paint resulting in fading and chalking.
- was tested and proven by the U.S. Department of Energy’s Oak Ridge National Laboratory to reduce cooling costs up to 21.9%*. 

TEX-COTE is dedicated to leading the paint and coatings industry in becoming a true “green” manufacturing company and reducing the impact that we all have on the environment. From incorporating recycled content into our product line, to the cooling cost energy savings that can be obtained through COOLWALL® heat reflective coatings, TEX-COTE® is dedicated to working towards a more sustainable future for everyone.

MOUSE:	Energy savings of up to 21.9% is based on the Department of Energy study which showed savings on homes with COOLWALL® ranged from 4.2% to 21.9%.


Is COOLWALL® really any better than premium traditional paints and other home exterior coating options? Yes, and it’s not even close. The COOLWALL® System (3.0) with Kynar Infrared Technology comes in more than 570 colors, each specially formulated to reflect solar heat without fading. The ability of COOLWALL® to keep wall surfaces cooler is based on its ability to reflect a much greater percentage of the non-visible portion of the spectrum relatively unaffected. No regular paint or other coatings can do that.

COOLWALL® is thicker than regular paint (how much thicker depends upon the application) and when applied with MidSouth Coating’s professional 10-step installation process (3.3), provides a home’s exterior with maximum protection against the elements. COOLWALL® waterproofs the home while allowing it to breathe and release moisture. The resin in this advanced exterior home coating with Kynar is thermoplastic, so it expands and contracts with the surface of the home, eliminating cracking, splitting, peeling, or coming loose. Finally, the COOLWALL® System comes with a lifetime warranty (3.1).


How much can I save on my cooling costs with COOLWALL®? COOLWALL® has been tested by the U.S. Department of Energy’s Oak Ridge National Laboratory to reduce cooling costs by up to 21.9% (3.2)* (a DOE study showed savings ranging from 4.2 – 21.9%). The percentage of cooling costs and surface temperature reductions will vary based on color chosen, geographical location, climate conditions, and substrate type. The more the AC unit ran before COOLWALL® was applied, the more homeowners will save. In the Gulf Coast region, the savings are more substantial than the north.


What if I can’t find the exact COOLWALL® color I want? The COOLWALL® System comes in more than 570 beautifully resilient colors, but if you need MidSouth Coatings to mix a special color for you, we’re ready, willing, and able to accommodate any request. Don’t forget to try our COOLWALL® color finder (2.0) first.


How long will my COOLWALL® color last? The COOLWALL® system is designed to last a lifetime. Testing in the manufacturer’s state-of-the-art xenon weathering chamber showed the COOLWALL® system was still performing beautifully after the equivalent of more than 10 years exposure, with no end in sight. 


What are my payment options? MidSouth Coatings is pleased to accept personal checks, all major credit cards, or cash payments. We also offer convenient finance options, including 12 months, same as cash. Give us a call (phone) to discuss which options work best for you.

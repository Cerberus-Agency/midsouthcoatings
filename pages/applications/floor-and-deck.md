#COOL-TEC® HEAT-REFLECTIVE FLOOR & DECK COATING FOR WOOD AND CONCRETE APPLICATIONS.

Perfect for concrete and wood decks, walkways, patios, pool decks, and balconies; COOL-TEC&reg; provides a much cooler, slip-resistant walking surface that is barefoot friendly. And because COOL-TEC&reg; provides for lower surface temperatures (up to 40° difference), the reduction in radiant energy leads to enhanced durability and superior fade resistance. 

Ideal for restoring worn or weathered concrete or wood deck surfaces, COOL-TEC&reg; is thicker than ordinary coatings and does a superior job filling hairline cracks, covering splinters, and hiding all manner of flooring and deck imperfections. COOL-TEC&reg; is [available in over 570 heat-reflective colors](/color-chart), ensuring an ideal color match to your home or business design. With a five-year product warranty against defects, this advanced formulation incorporates glass microspheres that deliver superior scratch, abrasion, and burnish resistance.

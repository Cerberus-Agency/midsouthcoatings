4.2 COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS:

HEAD:   BUSINESSES ACROSS THE GLOBE TRUST OUR COATINGS PRODUCTS.

COPY:   Utilizing the same technology pioneered by the U.S. Military to reduce the heat signature of combat vehicles, COOLWALL® was created by one of the most advanced coatings manufacturers in the world, TEX-COTE®. It’s no wonder more than 3,000 gallons of their products are applied around the world every day. From office buildings and retail stores, to warehouses and manufacturing facilities, to schools and churches, all benefit from superior protection from the elements while presenting a beautiful appearance that lasts.

Thicker than paint, COOLWALL® is impervious to water penetration, an essential performance parameter in humid and moist climates. This advanced commercial-grade coating also allows the underlying building surface to breathe, helping to prevent decay and the growth of mold and mildew. The COOLWALL® coating system can be applied on virtually any substrate, including masonry blocks, brick, wood, cement, stucco, and metal. It can even help business owners lower the temperature of their exterior walls, helping to reduce energy use and curbing company cooling costs. A study conducted by the U.S. Department of Energy’s Oak Ridge National Laboratory showed that COOLWALL® coatings can reduce cooling costs by as much as 21.9%*.

MidSouth Coatings provides businesses across the Gulf South with complete start-to-finish exterior coating services, including exterior wall repair and preparation prior to application. Our expert installation teams work quickly and efficiently to minimize disruption for business owners, employees, tenants and customers—delivering protection that is reliable, permanent, attractive and virtually maintenance free.

Protecting your commercial property from the elements is the best way to preserve and protect your investment. Smart property owners choose MidSouth Coatings to provide a lifetime of superior protection and significant energy savings, delivering all the benefits of high-grade exterior painting that competitive businesses need to attract customers, such as a range of colors and finish options (smooth, sand, fine, coarse). All this, and it’s backed by a powerful manufacturer’s warranty.

<h1>“We have been very pleased in all our dealings with Kevin Mmahat and his company, MidSouth Coatings. It's a smart product and well worth the cost. He is honest, works within the budget, and the results are stellar. The fact that Kevin is a local boy is another reason to do business with him. We can recommend him wholeheartedly.” <span>★★★★★ - David Palmisano</span></h1>

MidSouth Coatings coated my house approximately five years ago. My home still looks brand new. The process was very easy, the crews were efficient and cleaned up after themselves every single day. They worked from sun up to sundown until the job was 100% complete. Very good local company, highly recommended. Money well spent!

Bought coating from Kevin. Installation timeframe and quality of job were great. Coating should help insulate my home better and the upgraded color scheme really makes the house look good. I would recommend to my friends. Nice work and friendly people.

Mid-South Coatings came highly referred through a friend of mine. The salesman set an appointment with me that best suited my schedule. He showed up on time, walked me through the process of what they would do for my home. I knew it would cost me more than what I normally pay to have my house painted. I was tired of painting my house over and over again. My house looks so beautiful and the best thing is I never have to paint it again. Would I recommend MidSouth Coatings to my friends, I sure would without a doubt. The owner even called me after the job was done to make sure I was satisfied with what his company did for me. One Happy Customer!
